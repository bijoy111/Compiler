# CSE 310 | Compiler
The department of CSE of BUET offered a course named CSE 310 (compiler) in level 3, term 1, which contains four offline.
This repository contains the spec, code and sample i/o  of those four offline.
Though these four codes were error-free and passed the test case given, if you want to get help from this code, then first download the code. 
Then, you can just run on your machine and check with your test case to find any corner case.

Here is the [`course outline`](/Course%20Outline%20and%20Course%20Outcome.pdf)
